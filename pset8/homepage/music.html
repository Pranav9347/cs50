                I started learning music when I was in fourth grade. We lived in an apartment at that time and our neighbour was a music teacher. I learnt some basics of Carnatic Classical music there. Later, I joined another music center where I learnt to play the keyboard too. I passed my Junior Music exam in 7th grade. I've always loved music even from my childhood. Infact my interest in music has inspired me to base my Final Project of cs50 on music!

                One thing that I cannot forget mentioning is about the Sanskrit language which is my favourite language. I learnt Sanskrit in school from 5th grade to 12th grade and have also written upto 4th level exam in Sanskrit. Sanskrit is particularly beautiful because of its rich grammar, vast number of words and poetry. The expressibility, poetic aesthtics, etc. are fascinating and engrossing. Though it is not the easiest language to learn, learning it is definitely worth it especially if you are a linguaphile. I wish to master this language and spread its beauty to as many as possible. Please check out my article on <a href="https://indicsense.medium.com/the-beauty-of-sanskrit-language-39d67dffd6e2">The Beauty Of Sanskrit Language</a>  if you want to explore the language.
