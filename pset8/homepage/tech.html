                <b><i>There are a few incidents in my life which motivated and encouraged me to study Science:</i></b><br>
                Till this incident, I was always studying for academic validation/get higher grades (also as I'm an Asian&#128517;).
                In eighth-grade, my friend and I who were the class toppers always competed with each other for a higher rank. Once during our math class, as always, we were a few problem sets ahead of the class. It was a smooth flow until we got stuck in one of the problems in algebra (which is kinda hard to solve for beginners) 'the age problems' (like finding a person's age based on some given information). We couldn't solve it on our own as we did others. After school, I went home and took it as a challenge to solve it by myself. I read the question several times, broke down the problem into smaller parts and encoded the given information into the required math after understanding it slowly. I solved the obtained equations and was over the moon when I saw that the correct answer matched mine! From that point onwards I developed genuine interest in learning Science and have always been loving it since then!

                Further, when I was in the ninth grade I joined <a href = https://baseedu.in>BASE</a> educational classes as it was popular in my school and the science concepts were taught in a greater depth than in school. I was amused by the beauty of physics when I learnt about vectors and projectile motion. Since then, physics has been my favourite branch of science. The lectures of Sir Walter Lewin from MIT (which I watched from the <a href = https://ocw.mit.edu>MIT OpenCourseWare</a>) further inspired me to learn physics.

            After seeing the wonders of Computer Science and its impact to the world I really wanted to become a Computer Science engineer and be able to code. So I had a lot of uncertainty and confusion while choosing my major. Now, I have planned to major in Computer Science and study Physics along with it, as my institution offers elective courses in Physics subjects. So that has led me to this point! My dad has guided me in my jounery of pursuing a CS degree as he is also a Computer Science engineer. He recommended me to take the amazing <a href = https://cs50.harvard.edu> CS50 </a> course offered by the Harvard University which gave me an edge over other students in my college and made me love CS even more, especially because of the way Prof. David J Malan (CS50 course instructor) teaches. I've acquired most of the CS skills from this course itself because of how comprehensive it is! Have a look at some of the codes that I've written <a href = https://github.com/Pranav9347/My_programs.git>here</a>.
