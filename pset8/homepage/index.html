            <p><!--tech-->
                I'm a Tech Enthusiast and anything related to Science or Tech attracts me. I chose Computer Science as it has vast applications in various fields of Science and the ability to communicate with computers is a great and an extremely useful skill. CS has impacted the world greatly especially with the invent of The Internet which has transformed the whole world! If you want to know more about my interests in tech, read <a href=tech.html>here</a>.
            </p>
            <p><!--music-->
                I love listening to music and hence have explored music theory too! I've learnt Carnatic Classical Music(Classical style South Indian music). I can play some songs on the keyboard which I love doing. Read more about my music and arts interests <a href=music.html>here</a>.
            </p>
            <p><!--Entertainment-->
                Who doesn't watch anime in 2023? I don't! I'm kidding, my favourite anime is 'Death Note' and I'm currently watching 'Attack on Titan'. I was so addicted to watching Death Note that I completed the entire series in just a week!
                My favorite TV series is the American sitcom 'Young Sheldon'.
                How can a CS student not like video games? I've recently started playing VALORANT and I'm absolutely in love with it! The graphics, game mechanics is amazing and a has a lot of stuff to explore. I love sports too! My favorite sport is badminton.
